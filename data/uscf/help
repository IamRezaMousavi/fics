Usage: uscf [string]

  As a service to users, USCF (the United States Chess Federation) has given
us a file of USCF tournament information.  We have these tournaments divided 
into several sections (similarly to "Chess Life"): National, Gran_prix,
Beginners and the various states of the United States according to state
appreviation (with two sections for CA: ca_n and ca_s for northern and
southern California).

  Typing "uscf" alone will list the various files that can be used as strings
for this command.  Use "string" to select which of these states or types of
tournaments to display.  For example, "uscf ny" will display upcoming
tournaments in New York and "uscf gran_prix" will list upcoming Gran Prix
events (tournaments having points that count to a special annual prize). 
Typing "uscf help" will display this help file.

  Information about USCF is presented in the "uscf_faq" help file.
