admins

  Admins on this server have various functions.  Many are here solely for
programming reasons; when they are logged on, they are often busy and working
with the server code.  Other admins are here for general assistance to users. 
There are also special accounts that make it easy for users to give the admins
feedback, suggestions and special requests.  Here is a breakdown....

* No longer an admin but he deserves his share of the credit.                 

Note:  Admins have been chosen based on some simple but important criteria.
       Programmer admins obviously are chosen for ability and willingness
       to volunteer much time and energy toward the GNU-ICS project.  In
       general, however, a good working knowledge of the game itself along
       with some practical tournamant experience is quite valuable.  Even
       more valuable is Tournamant directorship experience either on the club
       or national level.  Also of great value is a knowledge of different
       computers and operating systems and the ability to help new players
       with setting up interfaces and getting started toward their first
       game.  :-)
