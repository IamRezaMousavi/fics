blindfold

    Blindfold accounts are special accounts for users who wish to play without
a board.  Users playing blindfold chess must use style 9 while playing since
this style displays only the last few moves, not the board position.  Since
style 9 does not list the times on the chess clocks, you may wish to use the
"time" command in order to list clock times.

  Users on the "blind" list will have the notation "(B)" displayed behind
their handles on who displays and will have their handles displayed when a
user types "=blind" (to show the contents of the list of players having
blindfold accounts chess).  Users who have blindfold accounts must use style 9
when playing.  Not using style 9 to play will be considered abuse and make you
subject to sanctions.

  In order to be included on the blindfold list or to have an additional
account for blindfold chess, please contact an admin.
