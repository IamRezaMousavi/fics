cls_info

  Typing "help cls" will clear your screen and set the cursor at the top.  The
alias for "help cls" is now "cls".  This command may be useful if you need to
clear your screen suddenly for some reason (like the boss walking in on you
unexpectedly).  Server messages will soon appear again, however.
