pause

Usage: pause

  A "pause" request asks your opponent that the game you are playing be paused --
though not adjourned.  An accepted pause request has the effect of rolling
back the clocks to the time of the last move.  If your opponent has given you
a pause request, using the pause command (or accept) will accept the request. 
You may decline a pause request by using the decline command.  To unpause a
game use "unpause".

  You might want to consider using pause rather than adjourn if, for example,
you want to consult with an admin about a problem with the match.
