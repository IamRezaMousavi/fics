  You can get a version of the code via anonymous ftp to 'ftp.onenet.net' in
the directory /pub/chess/Unix.  You can also obtain files using the
"mailsource" command.

  We encourage you, the chess server community, to help improve and debug this
server.  If you make any changes to the code that you would like to see
incorporated into future releases, please contact one of the senior
programming admins.
