team

  It is possible to have a "team" account on the chess server.  Team accounts
would be good for groups of players (whether human or computer) to play chess
matches against either individual players or other teams.  These accounts are
designed for relatively stable groups of players, in contrast to teams formed
spontaneously for just one match (see "teamgames" help file).  Good examples
would be chess clubs at schools or companies.

  If you represent a group of players who would like to form a team for a team
account, contact an admin.  The team handle will be added to the "team" list
and will have the "(T)" designation appearing on who lists.
