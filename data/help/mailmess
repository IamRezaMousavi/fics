LIMITED TO REGISTERED USERS

  There are two ways to have your messages mailed to you: (a) all messages
currently stored for you sent as a group, and (b) automatically each time a
message arrives.  The first method uses a command; the second method uses a
variable setting.  REMINDER: only registered users can have stored messages.


STORED MESSAGES

  Use the "mailmess" command to send to you at your e-mail address the
messages currently being stored for you.  In this way you can archive the
messages on your own computer and then clear the message buffer on the chess
server.  A reduced message buffer makes new messages easier to identify and
read.  (You may want to clear unwanted messages first, then mailmes.)


AUTOMATICALLY ONE-AT-A-TIME

  When the "mailmess" variable is set to 1, each message you receive from a
user will be automatically e-mailed to you at your email address.
