convert_uscf

Usage: convert_uscf #

  This command will convert a USCF rating into BCF and ELO ratings.  All three
values will be displayed to you.  The conversion formulas are:
    USCF = ELO + 100
    BCF = (ELO - 600)/8

  BCF ratings are the official ratings of the British Chess Federation.  USCF
ratings are the official ratings of the United States Chess Federation.  ELO
ratings often used in international competition.

  Server ratings are, of course, something entirely different.  There is no
exact way at present to convert server ratings into equivalent official
ratings.  For server rating information, see "rating" and "glicko".
