Usage: cnewsi message
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

  This command adds a new item to the news index.  The message is limited to
45 characters for formating purposes.  In essence, the news index works like a
newspaper headline, giving the user enough information to know whether they
should read the entire news file for that item.  After creating the news item,
the command reports the news item number along with a reminder to create a
news file if necessary.  This command replaced the 'createnews' command.
