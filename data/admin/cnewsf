Usage: cnewsf # message
RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

   This command allows you to add additional information about a news item
that had previously been created using 'cnewsi'.  The '#' is the number of the
news index and 'message' is the additional text.  You can also modify a
previous news item description and thus update the news item easily.
